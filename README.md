# Enzyme-Substrate-Multi-Label-Classification

Enzymes are known to act on molecules with structural similarities with their substrates. This behaviour is called promiscuity. Scientists working in drug discovery use this behaviour to target/design drugs to either block or promote biological actions. But, correct prediction of EC class(s) of substrates associated with enzymes has been a challenge in biology. Since there is no shortage of data, ML techniques can be employed to solve the aforementioned problem.

Submissions were evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the ground truth for each target, and the final score was the average of the individual AUCs of each predicted column.
